I'm a technology professional with over nine years of experience in embedded systems, where I've developed and maintained **firmware** across a variety of platforms and architectures. In the past three years, my focus has increasingly shifted toward **embedded security**, researching vulnerabilities, reinforcing device-level protections, and exploring the intersection of hardware and cybersecurity.

Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Cybersecurity to deepen my expertise in **network security**, systems architecture, and threat mitigation strategies. My programming toolkit includes **C**, C++, Bash scripting, Python, Go and Assembly, but I'm always eager to learn new languages or tools that enable efficient and effective problem solving.

I'm passionate about **connected systems, secure design**, and the evolving landscape of embedded technologies. Through this blog, I aim to share insights, hands-on techniques, and lessons learned at the crossroads of firmware development and cybersecurity.
